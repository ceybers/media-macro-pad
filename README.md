- Volume dial
- Connects via BLE
- 500mAh battery
- Charges via USB-C

## 📐 Changes

> Currently waiting on 3D prints to be completed.

 - Relocated heatset inserts and bosses
 - Added lugs/lips to help align parts
 - Added support ribs/gussets
 - Changed top shell to use a magnet to stay in place
 - Fixed position of power switch
 - Correct spacing for MCU mounting
 - Removed LED
 - Offset knob to protude from rear of case
## ⚠️ Issues

> Current STL/FreeCAD models are not suitable for actual use!

- Heat set inserts on top shell poorly placed - head of screw collides with walls of shell
- Holes for heat set inserts were too small (Ø3.0mm in CAD)
- Holes for heat set did not have fillets to help guide placement
- Walls for heat set inserts too thin (1.5mm) - melted during placement
- Power switch slightly too tall for height of middle shell
- Insufficient clearance between contacts of power switch and rotary encoder base
- Incorrect spacing for standoffs for the MCU board
- Placement of MCU's battery connect (JST-PH) collides with heat set column
- Wall around opening for LED would have helped with alignment

## 🛒 Bill of Materials (BOM)

> ⚠️ BoM is out of date and needs to be updated for latest revision.
