## üß∞ Features

- 6√ó programmable keys via [MK32 firmware](https://github.com/Galzai/MK32)
- Volume dial
- Connects via BLE
- 500mAh battery
- Charges via USB-C

## üìê Changes

 - Relocated heatset inserts and bosses
 - Added lugs/lips to help align parts
 - Added support ribs/gussets
 - Changed top shell to use a magnet to stay in place
 - Fixed position of power switch
 - Correct spacing for MCU mounting
 - Removed LED
 - Offset knob to protude from rear of case
## ‚ö†Ô∏è Issues

> Current STL/FreeCAD models are not suitable for actual use!

- Top shell isn't secured firmly with only one magnet
- Lugs on top shell need to be made smaller to fit into slots in middle shell
- Tolerances around cutout for rotary encoder knob are too tight and need filing down

## üõí Bill of Materials (BOM)

> ‚ö†Ô∏è BoM is out of date and needs to be updated for latest revision.
